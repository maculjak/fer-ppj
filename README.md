#fer-ppj

This repository contains source code of a simple C-like compiler built as a part of Programming Language Translation university course. The compiler operates in four phases: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis and code generation. Lexical analyzer generator and syntax analyzer generators are similar to LEX and YACC programmes, but greatly simplified.
